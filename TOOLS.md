# DevSecOps Homelab Setup

This document outlines the components and tools used in setting up a DevSecOps homelab. The primary focus is on version control, CI/CD, and security scanning.

## Version Control

### GitLab Community

GitLab Community Edition (CE) is an open-source version control system that provides comprehensive features for managing code repositories, tracking issues, and collaborating on software development projects.

**Key Features:**

- **Repository Management:** Supports both Git and SVN repositories.
- **Branching and Merging:** Simplifies code merging and conflict resolution.
- **Issue Tracking:** Integrates with issues, pull requests, and other project management tools.
- **Code Review:** Facilitates peer reviews with merge requests.

**Usage:**

- **Version Control:** Efficiently check in code and maintain version history.
- **Collaboration:** Enable team collaboration through shared repositories and merge requests.

## CI/CD Tool or Framework

### GitLab Runners

GitLab Runners are lightweight, portable agents that run CI/CD jobs on GitLab. They can be configured to run on various platforms and are highly scalable.

**Key Features:**

- **Job Execution:** Executes CI/CD jobs defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files.
- **Scalability:** Easily scales with the number of concurrent jobs.
- **Multi-Platform:** Supports running jobs on different operating systems and architectures.

**Usage:**

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitLab repositories.

## Security Scanning

### SAST: GitLab

GitLab provides built-in Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to analyze source code for vulnerabilities and security issues.

**Key Features:**

- **Code Analysis:** Scan code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors.
- **Integration:** Integrates with GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated scanning.
- **Reporting:** Generate detailed reports on security findings.

**Usage:**

- **Security Scanning:** Continuously scan code to identify and fix security issues.
- **Compliance:** Ensure code meets security standards and best practices.

### DAST: OWASP ZAP

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a popular tool for Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). It scans running applications for vulnerabilities by simulating attacks.

**Key Features:**

- **Active Scanning:** Actively probes web applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Passive Scanning:** Monitors application traffic for potential issues without interfering.
- **Automation:** Supports automation through scripts and APIs.

**Usage:**

- **Security Testing:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in running applications.
- **Integration:** Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing.

### Open Source Dependency Scanning: GitLab

GitLab's built-in capability for Open Source Dependency Scanning identifies vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used in the project.

**Key Features:**

- **Dependency Analysis:** Scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Updates:** Suggest updates or patches for vulnerable dependencies.
- **Reporting:** Provide detailed reports on dependency vulnerabilities.

**Usage:**

- **Dependency Management:** Ensure third-party libraries and dependencies are secure.
- **Compliance:** Maintain security compliance by addressing vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Hosting GitLab in Google Cloud

### Using Google Cloud Marketplace

**Overview:**
Deploying GitLab from the Google Cloud Marketplace simplifies the installation process. This option is ideal for quick deployments with minimal configuration.

**Steps:**

1. **Visit Google Cloud Marketplace:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace) and search for "GitLab."

2. **Launch GitLab:**
   - Click on the GitLab listing and follow the prompts to configure and launch the instance.
   - Choose the machine type and configure networking settings.

3. **Configure DNS and SSL:**
   - Set up DNS records to point to your GitLab instance's external IP address.
   - Configure SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity:** Quick and easy deployment with minimal configuration.
- **Pre-configured:** Comes with GitLab pre-installed and configured.
- **Support:** Access to Google Cloud support for marketplace deployments.

### Best Practices for Hosting GitLab on Google Cloud Platform

1. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Use Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging to monitor the performance and health of your GitLab instance.
   - Set up alerts to notify you of any issues.

2. **Security:**
   - Use Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to your resources.
   - Enable firewall rules to restrict access to your GitLab instance.
   - Regularly update GitLab and underlying software to patch vulnerabilities.

3. **Backups:**
   - Regularly back up your GitLab data to Google Cloud Storage.
   - Test your backup and restore process to ensure data integrity.

4. **High Availability:**
   - Use multiple instances or nodes to ensure high availability.
   - Configure load balancing to distribute traffic across instances.

5. **Cost Management:**
   - Monitor your Google Cloud usage and costs using the Google Cloud Console.
   - Optimize resource usage to minimize costs.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively host GitLab on Google Cloud, ensuring a robust, secure, and scalable environment for your DevSecOps needs.
